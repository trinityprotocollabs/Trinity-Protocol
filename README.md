# Trinity Protocol Foundation

Building the **universal standard for tokenized yield aggregation**.

## What We're Building

Trinity Protocol is an open-source infrastructure standard (MIT License) that unifies the $10 trillion tokenized asset market through:

- **60% U.S. Treasury Bills** (4.2% yield, Fidelity custody)
- **30% Bitcoin staking** (2.5% yield, Babylon Protocol)  
- **10% Money Market Fund** (4.5% yield, instant liquidity)

**Net user yield:** 3.2%  
**Target market:** $150B CEX custody ‚Üí $10T by 2030

## Why Trinity Matters

Circle USYC proved demand: **$100M in 90 days** (DeFi only, 15M users)

Trinity targets **$150B CEX custody** (10√ó larger market, 150M+ users)

## The Mission

Centralized exchanges hold $150-240B in user custody earning **0% yield**.

**Annual opportunity cost:** $6.3 billion

Trinity solves this through:
- ‚úÖ Legal framework (GENIUS Act compliant, Circle precedent)
- ‚úÖ 5-mechanism system (infinite liquidity, AI optimization, composability)
- ‚úÖ Open standard (MIT License, standards win by adoption)
